In this project, I updated the skeleton support code to generate projections of a given dataset and visualize them on the front-end. The tasks I accomplished were as follows:

Firstly, I copied the scatterplot and confusion matrix code from the previous week's work into the provided code for this week.

Next, I set up the server and ensured that the HTML file could be run in a web browser.

Then, I calculated the projections using different methods. Specifically, for t-SNE, I experimented with different perplexity values (2, 5, 10, and 20) and selected the one that best suited the application. I explained my rationale for choosing a specific perplexity value in my write-up.

Additionally, I had the option to create a user interface change that allowed users to update the perplexity argument in the front-end, propagate it to the server, and visualize the resulting t-SNE projection. This made the application interactive and full-stack.

To visualize the projections, I implemented the necessary code for a scatterplot. I handled the "on change" event generated by the radio buttons, adjusted the domain when the current projection option was not axis-aligned, and added tooltips to display the attributes of data points when hovered over.

I also studied t-SNE by reading the provided article and experimenting with the mentioned tool. In my write-up, I discussed the analytical tasks for which t-SNE is suitable and its limitations.

Lastly, I answered the following questions in a write-up:

Did the addition of projections change my choice of prediction model for the Somerville Happiness dataset? I explained my reasoning.
I compared the usefulness of the four projections (PCA, MDS, t-SNE, and UMAP) and the original axis-aligned scatterplot for selecting the best model. I explained my reasoning.
I identified potential harm that can be caused by using the projections explored in the lab.
Overall, this project aimed to enhance my understanding and application of different projections in the context of model selection, while also providing opportunities for interactive visualization and analysis.
