In this project, I focused on developing a visualization system for Model Selection. The main objective was to create intuitive visualizations of model predictions and interactive data exploration tools. The goal was to empower users to make informed decisions when selecting models, aiming to enhance the transparency and efficiency of the model selection process and ultimately improve the outcome of the modeling process.
