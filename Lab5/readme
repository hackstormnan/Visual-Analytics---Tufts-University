Using my code from Lab #4, I have added additional functionality to implement new interactions in my charts. These include tooltips that allow for hovering, dropdown selections to update the axes, and radio buttons to update the values being plotted. I have also included legends in both charts to provide a clear understanding of the colors used. In addition to these new features, I have retained all the original elements from Lab #4, such as dot and bar colors, axis labels, and grid lines.
